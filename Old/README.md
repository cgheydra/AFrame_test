# AFrame test

In this repository I test the AFrame WebVR framework

* Combining AFrame and static HTML is not a good idea. Although it is possible if you set the z-index of the html.
* Because it is just HTML-based objects, manipulating the HTML with JS .getAttribute and .setAttribute works fine. As well as using setInterval to do it continuously.
